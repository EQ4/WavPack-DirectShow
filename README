This package contains all the source code required to build the DirectShow
splitter and decoder filters for the WavPack audio format. This code was
originally written by Christophe Paris and was part of CoreCodec.org, but
is now maintained and distributed by Conifer Software. It is licensed under
the GNU General Public License (although the WavPack library portion is
additionally distributed under the modified BSD license).

This is currently set up to build with Visual Studio 2008 and the v7.1 SDK.
Note that you will first need to build strmbase.lib and strmbasd.lib in the
Samples directory of the SDK. There is also a NSIS script to create an
installer, although this requires a manual step.
